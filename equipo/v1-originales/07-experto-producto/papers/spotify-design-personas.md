Spotify personas are the topic of much discussion by those in the product, design, and user research communities. Here, the authors explain how they developed their personas tool, how they use it today, and why it's so useful for an autonomous, cross-functional organisation like Spotify.

## The Challenge

Here at Spotify, we often ask ourselves whom we're designing for. Since listening to music is so universally popular, it might seem at first that the answer is 'everyone'. Yet designing for a mass, generalised audience isn't likely to end up pleasing 'everyone'.

In 2017, the team was challenged to create a better understanding of existing and potential listeners. They needed:
- A solution durable and flexible enough to work for autonomous teams
- Working out of different offices, in different countries
- On different parts of the products
- To put a face to listeners — an identity everyone at Spotify could recognise

## How We Crafted the Personas

### Phase 1 (2017)

Scoped to US listeners due to size and variety of listening behaviours (long commutes, suburban lifestyles, etc.).

Initially considered clustering behaviours from data, but moved away because it:
- Revealed only superficial knowledge
- Concealed reasons behind behaviour
- Failed to help understand why potential customers listen to music

Instead, studied listeners of different ages, incomes, family types, lifestyles, music cultures using **diary studies and contextual inquiries**.

**Key finding**: People's needs/reasons for listening were consistent across clusters (kill boredom, feel productive, entertain). What differed was their **attitude towards music consumption**, the **value they saw in paying for music**, and their **behaviours around devices in different contexts**.

Used a combination of Alan Cooper's method and Grounded Theory approach:
1. Transcribed interviews minute-by-minute
2. Coded and clustered into needs, attitudes, device habits, contexts
3. Identified best cluster combinations

Tools: Mural and Airtable.

### Phase 2 (2018)

Built on Phase 1 insight: **when it comes to music listening, context matters**.

Combined learnings with literature review of theories from sociotechnical systems and adaptive computing. Focused on **how people listen to music together** — at home, in the car, with kids.

Included roommates, empty nesters, partners with and without kids, households with toddlers, teenagers, etc.

Used bottom-up Grounded Theory Approach analysis, resulting in the **Listening Together Framework™**.

> While people might have the same problems or needs, the existing habits determine the methods they use to address those problems. Attitudes determine how different people will adopt products.

## Representing Personas

Challenges:
- Want them relatable but not 1:1 matches with real people
- Believable human traits create empathy
- Don't want groups wrongly excluded based on picked characteristics

Solution:
- Arbitrarily picked genders, names and appearances matching interview range
- Reduced representation to **keywords, colours, symbols, and energy levels**
- Used **flat illustrations with brand colours** for abstract look
- Easy to reproduce in high or low fidelity

## Sharing the Work

Started thinking about communication from the beginning of research. Communication strategy includes:

**Digital assets**: Interactive website shared across offices (not just Google presentations that get lost).

**Physical assets**: Cardboard cutouts, card games — fun, playful ways to incorporate into workflows.

**Workshops**: "Learning by doing" — user research team hosted workshops with product teams.

## Impact

Since teams are autonomous, no one was mandated to use personas. Yet many teams beyond product adopted them — Marketing, Content, and Brand.

**Use cases:**
- Teams creating features from scratch: choose personas → map opportunities → pick direction → ideate
- Teams maintaining features: map work against personas → create mental model diagrams → refine features
- Product roadmaps centered around specific personas

> We can't optimise a feature for every single one of our listeners. So today, it's common to see teams having their product roadmaps centred around specific personas.

## Key Learnings

- **Over-communicate**: Regular cadence to share details and progress. Used Facebook Workplace, Slack, and emails.
- **Keep disciplines close**: Design, user research, and data science integrated throughout the process.
- **Know your audience**: Spent time getting to know team workflows, running pilot workshops, inviting to fieldwork to build trust.

Future plans: Expand and adapt personas for markets outside the US, broaden to include podcasts.
