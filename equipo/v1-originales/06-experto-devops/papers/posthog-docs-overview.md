## About our docs

There are a few ways to explore our docs:

**On our website:**
- PostHog AI chatbot - Start a chat on any docs page with relevant context
- Search with the icon at the top right
- Ask a question at the end of each docs article (cross-posted to community forums)

**In the product:**
- Look for tooltips that link to docs - they open right inside the product
- Ask PostHog AI in the product

## Feedback
Our docs are perpetually a work in progress. At the end of each page, you can provide feedback about what was (or wasn't) helpful.

> Note: The main docs landing page had minimal content. PostHog is a product analytics platform offering: analytics, session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, and surveys.
