Vercel is the AI Cloud for building and deploying modern web applications, from static sites to AI-powered agents.

You can build and host many different types of applications on Vercel, static sites with your favorite framework, multi-tenant applications, or microfrontends, to AI-powered agents.

You can also use the Vercel Marketplace to find and install integrations such as AI providers, databases, CMSs, analytics, storage, and more.

When you are ready to build, connect your Git repository to deploy on every push, with automatic preview environments for testing changes before production.
