## How machines conquered our skills, infiltrated our aesthetics, and left us with one final advantage

Wittgenstein once wrote that when the eye sees something beautiful, the hand wants to draw it.

This line, from The History of Love, runs through my mind almost daily. The eye and what it admires is how I think of taste.

Today's popular opinion is that great taste is a key advantage that humans have over AI. But is this true?

To explore this question, I had a chat with Ivan Zhao, CEO and co-founder of Notion. I was particularly eager to sit down with Ivan both because Notion is one of my favorite products and because he's a founder whose taste I greatly admire.

### AI is winning the capabilities race

Every generation has watched technology surpass us in new domains.

First our physical skills were defeated: machines could plow fields, move loads, and spin thread faster and more tirelessly than we ever could.

Then our analytical skills fell: calculators could multiply and derive thousands of numbers in the time it takes you to read this sentence. Algorithms began trading stocks, detecting fraud, and recommending ways to part with your money more effectively than any human brain. One by one, computers defeated our greatest champions of strategic games in chess, go, and even Starcraft.

Now, even our creative skills are under assault. ChatGPT writes a sharper essay than most college graduates. Midjourney creates more professional artwork than many artists. Whether it's code or music, videos or graphics, dozens of startups are ruthlessly competing to demonstrate how AI can produce work that's indistinguishable from what we used to call a marvel.

The most skilled humans today still outcompete AI in complex reasoning and innovation. But as AI grows smarter, its infinite patience and inexhaustible speed will make it even more capable of taking over more and more human lanes.

### Taste is a fragile fortress

Today's conventional wisdom is that great taste is one of the last remaining bastions of human superiority. Whereas taste we've defined as one's values and preferences, great taste is when one's values and preferences are so refined that they can consistently spot excellence before others see it.

We've clung to this driftwood of taste because AI's current attempts at curation feel laughably generic. When AI recommends music, it tends toward safe, billboard-hit choices. When it tells jokes, it recycles material from generations of dads past rather than crack something worthy of a Netflix comedy special.

Perhaps some part of us believes taste is safe from AI dominance because it's subjective. After all, who can know my values and preferences better than me?

But great taste is more objective than we assume. To be deemed excellent implies social validation; some group of others must affirm the judgment!

If you say a friend has "excellent taste in music," it's because you've witnessed this friend selecting songs that you and other music-lovers vibe with. In other words, you believe your friend is a damn good predictor of what a discerning audience will appreciate.

This skill isn't just luck or innate musicality. Your friend is well-informed and I'm willing to bet good money she isn't the type who only listens to Top 40 stuff.

Tastemakers are voracious students of their discipline, obsessing over details that others might find tedious in their quest to uncover hidden gems. When they say "this song is great," it carries the authority of someone who has evaluated hundreds of similar tracks and can articulate exactly what makes this one distinct. They've built a foundational understanding that lets them discern the craft involved — what was technically challenging, what was innovative, how it connects to broader musical lineages.

Despite experts occasionally butting heads, well-informed communities tend toward consensus on greatness, especially over time. How many designers do you know who strongly feel Windows is better designed than MacOS? How many engineers do you know who sing the praises of C++ or Perl?

If excellent taste operates through pattern recognition across vast cultural knowledge, then it isn't a stretch to imagine that AI systems can replicate this process. They can absorb the same foundational context the best tastemakers do; they can track the preferences of frontier communities and learn to predict with increasing accuracy what a discerning individual will value. Seen as a prediction engine, human taste is far more vulnerable to AI competition than we'd like to admit.

That said, at the highest echelons, taste is not just prediction, it's also movement making. The most significant tastemakers take social risks. They might champion work that others find unfamiliar and stake their reputation on bold judgments that initially seem out of touch.

### Agency is the uniquely human moat

If AI can meet or surpass humans in capabilities and taste, what remains distinctly ours?

The answer is agency. The will and motivation to act on our values. Moving the hand to draw what the eye admires.

Even as AI becomes more capable, humans are still the ones to unknot problems that deserve attention. Human drive is what made AI in the first place; it's what will direct the work of this technology.

Human agency emerges from our subjective experience of life's purpose. We choose to play chess not because we're the best at it, but because the struggle of the game matters to us. Sometimes we choose to write so we can better connect with others; other times we write to think or feel. Who can determine the why except the self?

Our unique agency allows us to exercise a higher plane of creativity to direct our attention. Our specific will is what determines whether we progress toward our vision or slip into chaos.

Whether this advantage lasts depends on questions we're only beginning to understand about consciousness, purpose, and what it means to truly care about something.

But in a world where capabilities and even taste becomes commoditized, the will of the hand to act according to our values may well be our most rare and precious resource.
